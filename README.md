# E-Commerce Backend

## User Story
AS A manager at an internet retail company 
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies 
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies


## Description
This is the functional backend to e-commerce. E-commerce is commonly known as online shopping and has been a major part of the economy within the past decade. This application uses mySQL and express to get, fetch, and post, the seeds given in the starter code. This showcases the ability to use mySQL databases and Express routes.

      
## Usage
  _How to use:_
  In order to use this application, you must log in to mySQL with ```mysql -u root -p```. Create the schema with ```source schema.sql``` when in the db folder. Exit mySQL then run seeds and start with ```npm run seeds``` and ```npm start```
